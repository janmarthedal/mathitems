A [sequence](D19#sequence) $\{p_n\}$ in a [metric space](D20#metric-space) $X$ is said to [converge](=sequence-converges) if there is a [point](D20#metric-space-point) $p\in X$ with the following property: For every $\varepsilon>0$ there is an [integer](#integer) $N$ such that $n\geq N$ implies that $d(p_n,p)<\varepsilon$. (Here $d$ denotes the [distance](D20#metric-space-distance) in $X$.)

In this case we also say that $\{p_n\}$ [converges to](=sequence-converges-to) $p$.
