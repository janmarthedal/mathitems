Given a [complex](#complex-number)-[valued](D16#function-values) [sequence](D19#sequence) [$\{a_n\}$](D19#notation-sequence-curly-braces-x-n) we associate a sequence $\{s_n\}$, [where](D33#notation-complex-finite-summation)

$$s_n=\sum_{k=1}^na_k\;.$$

For $\{s_n\}$ we also use the symbolic expression

$$a_1+a_2+a_3+\cdots$$

or, more concisely,

$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n\;.$$

This last symbol we call an [infinite series](=infinite-complex-series), or just a [series](=complex-series). The numbers $s_n$ are called the [partial sums](=complex-series-partial-sum) of the series. If $\{s_n\}$ converges to $s$, we say that the series [converges](=complex-series-convergent), and write

$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n=s\;.$$

The number $s$ is called the [sum](=sum-of-complex-series) of the series.

If $\{s_n\}$ [diverges](D25#sequence-divergent), the series is said to [diverge](=complex-series-divergent).
