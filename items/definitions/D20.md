A [set](#set) $X$, whose [elements](#set-element) we shall call [points](=metric-space-point), is said to be a [metric space](=metric-space) if with any two points $p$ and $q$ of $X$ there is associated a [real number](#real-number) $d(p,q)$, called the [distance](=metric-space-distance) from $p$ to $q$, such that

1. $d(p,q)>0$ if $p\neq0$; $d(p,p)=0$;
2. $d(p,q)=d(q,p)$;
3. $d(p,q)\leq d(p,r)+d(r,q)$, for any $r\in X$.

Any [function](#function) with these three properties is called a [distance function](=distance-function), or a [metric](=metric).
