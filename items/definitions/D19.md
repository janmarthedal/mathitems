By a [sequence](=sequence), we mean a [function](D14#function) $f$ defined on the [set](#set) $J$ of all [positive integers](#positive-integer).

If $f(n)=x_n$, for $n\in J$, it is customary to denote the sequence $f$ by the symbol [$\{x_n\}$](=notation-sequence-curly-braces-x-n), or sometimes by $x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots$.

The [values](D16#function-values) of $f$, that is, the elements $x_n$, are called the [terms](=sequence-term) of the sequence.

If $A$ is a set and if $x_n\in A$ for all $n\in J$, then $\{x_n\}$ is said to be a [sequence in $A$](=sequence-in-set), or a [sequence of elements of $A$](=sequence-of-elements-of-set).
