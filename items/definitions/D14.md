Consider two [sets](#set) $A$ and $B$, whose [elements](#set-element) may be any objects whatsoever, and suppose that with each element $x$ of $A$ there is associated, in some manner, an element of $B$, which we denote by [$f(x)$](=notation-f-of-x). Then $f$ is said to be a [function](=function) from $A$ to $B$ (or a [mapping](=mapping) of $A$ into $B$).
