![Right-angled triangle with hypotenuse c, legs a and b, and height h](M4)

Since the triangle CBP is [similar](#euclidean-geometry-similar) to the triangle ABC, we have
$$
\frac{a}{c} = \frac{c'}{a} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad a^2 = c c' \; ,
$$
and since the triangle ACP is similar to the triangle ABC, we have
$$
\frac{b}{c} = \frac{c''}{b} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad b^2 = c c'' \; .
$$

We now have
$$
a^2 + b^2 = c c' + c c'' = c (c' + c'') = c^2 \; .
$$
