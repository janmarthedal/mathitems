![Right-angled triangle with hypotenuse c, legs a and b, and height h](M5)

The area of the triangle is expressible in two ways:
$$
\tfrac{1}{2} a b = \tfrac{1}{2} c h \; ,
$$
leading to
$$
c = \frac{a b}{h} \; .
$$
Squaring both sides and using the [Pythagorean theorem](T38), we obtain
$$
\frac{a^2 b^2}{h^2} = c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \; .
$$
Dividing both sides by $a^2 b^2$, we get
$$
\frac{1}{h^2} = \frac{a^2}{a^2 b^2} + \frac{b^2}{a^2 b^2} = \frac{1}{a^2} + \frac{1}{b^2} \; .
$$
