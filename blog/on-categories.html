A category, as used on teoremer, can be seen as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)">tag</a>Â with another category as parent. A special root tag is used to represent top-level categories and no cycles are allowed. This way all categories represent a rooted tree, or heirarchy, of tags.<!--more-->

Categories are useful for browsing or searching. Each tag may contain spaces and even inline math. For instance,
<blockquote><strong>/</strong> calculus <strong>/</strong> indefinite integrals <strong>/</strong> integrals involving [latex]\sqrt{a x + b}[/latex]</blockquote>
is a valid category.
