The site is now live! Note, however, that the software is still being heavily developed and many more features are still in the pipeline. There will be things that misbehave and there will probably be crashes.

We do need users, though. To test and, most importantly, to add content because [teoremer.com](http://teoremer.com) is nothing without content. And many users are needed to collectively create *quality* content.<span/>

To start off the site in a controlled way, the site is in a [closed beta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Open_and_closed_beta) stage. If you are interested in getting an account, please send an email to [team@teoremer.com](mailto:team@teoremer.com) and tell us a little about yourself (only for internal use; are you a student, teacher, researcher, other?). You will then receive an email with a link to a page where you can create your account.

We look forward to seeing you on [teoremer.com](http://teoremer.com).
