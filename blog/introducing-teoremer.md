If you distill any book or article on some mathematical subject, then what you are left with is usually a lot of notation, definitions, algorithms, theorems, lemmas, corollaries, and proofs. *teoremer* is a collection of such mathematical items.

The items are split into the following main types:
  * **Definition** (also used for notation and algorithm).
  * **Theorem** (also used for axiom, lemma, corollary, proposition).
  * **Proof** (of varying rigor).

Each item is given a unique name and can refer to other items.
