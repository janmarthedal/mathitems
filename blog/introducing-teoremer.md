If you distill any book or article on some mathematical subject, then what you are left with is usually a lot of notation, definitions, algorithms, theorems, lemmas, corollaries, and proofs of varying rigor. *teoremer* is a collection of such mathematical items.

The items are split into the following main types:
  * **definition** (also used for notation and algorithms)
  * **theorem** (also used for lemmas and corollaries)
  * **proof**

Each item is given a unique name and can refer/link to other items.
