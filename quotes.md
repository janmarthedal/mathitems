teoremer is all about theorems. Adding well-known, useful, rare, strange or original theorems; finding, browsing and discovering the theorems that is needed to solve some problem or just for fun.

What is a theorem? According to Merriam-Webster, a theorem is

a formula, proposition, or statement in mathematics or logic deduced or to be deduced from other formulas or propositions

A theorem should be expressed as a precise, formal statement.

What makes a theorem valid? A proof.

What makes a theorem well-posed? That all (essential) terms and concepts of the theorem has been defined.

= What is Mathematics? =

foo

mathematics, the science of structure, order, and relation that has evolved from elemental practices of counting, measuring, and describing the shapes of objects. -- Encyclopædia Britannica

quote

If our hypothesis is about anything, and not about some one or more particular things, then our deductions constitute mathematics. Thus mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true. -- Bertrand Russel in Mathematics and the Metaphysicians

foo

A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas. -- G. H. Hardy in A Mathematician's Apology

foo

there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics. -- G. H. Hardy in A Mathematician's Apology

= When is a Mathematical Statement True? =

rthrth

Mathematics is the most exact science, and its conclusions are capable of absolute proof. But this is so only because mathematics does not attempt to draw absolute conclusions. All mathematical truths are relative, conditional.

- Charles Proteus Steinmetz (1923, quoted in Men of Mathematics by E. T. Bell, page xvii)

eherhre

317 is a prime, not because we think so, or because our minds are shaped in one way rather than another, but because it is so, because mathematical reality is built that way.

- A Mathematician's Apology by G. H. Hardy, paragraph 24

etghrthr

For the rigorous development of a mathematical theory proceeds not simply from a set of definitions but rather from a set of non-definitional propositions which are not proved within the theory; these are the postulates or axioms of the theory.

- One the Nature of Mathematical Truth by Carl G. Hempel, section 5

ergregre

But the community itself is tiny. In most fields of mathematics there are few experts. Indeed, there are very few active research mathematicians in the world, and many important problems, so the ratio of the number of mathematicians to the number of problems is small. In every field, there are “bosses” who proclaim the correctness or incorrectness of a new result, and its importance or unimportance. Sometimes they disagree, like gang leaders fighting over turf. In any case, there is a web of semi-proved theorems throughout mathematics. Our knowledge of the truth of a theorem depends on the correctness of its proof and on the correctness of all of the theorems used in its proof. It is a shaky foundation.

- Desperately Seeking Mathematical Truth by Melvyn B. Nathanson (in Notices of the AMS, august 2008, pdf)

foo

many mathematical theorems are so hard to establish that even to the specialist in the particular field they appear as anything but self-evident.

- On the Nature of Mathematical Truth by Carl G. Hempel


= Proofs =

Elegance

We usually want more from a proof than a mere guarantee of correctness. We feel after reading a good proof that is provides an explanation of the theorem, that we understand something we did not understand before.

--- Mathematics - A Very Short Introduction, by Timothy Gowers, chapter 3

Rigor

I mean the word proof not in the sense of the lawyers, who set two half proofs equal to a whole one, but in the sense of a mathematician, where half a proof is zero, and it is demanded for proof that every doubt becomes impossible.

- Carl Friedrich Gauss, quoted in Calculus Gems
