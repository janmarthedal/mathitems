The items are split into the following main types:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Definitions</strong> (also used for notation and algorithms).</li>\n<li><strong>Theorems</strong> (also used for axioms, lemmas, corollaries, propositions).</li>\n<li><strong>Proofs</strong> (of varying rigor).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each item can refer to other items. This leads to a network of mathematical items with dependencies between them, or a directed graph where the nodes are the math items and the edges are the references, to put it another way.</p>\n\n<p>Once a math item&mdash;which lives up to the guidelines&mdash;is published, it is given a unique name and it can never be changed or edited in any way. Not ever. This prevents users from (accidentially) making true statements false. This also ensures that once you link to an item, you know exactly what you link to.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone can contribute and create new math items. A theorem can have any number of proofs and a given concept can have any number of definitions associated with it. A <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification' >gamification</a> system motivates high quality and ensures that a user can easily find the most useful item.</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to <em>teoremer</em>.</p>", 'title': 'Introducing teoremer'}]
