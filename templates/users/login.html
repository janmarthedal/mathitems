<p><b>teoremer</b> is currently in a closed beta phase. This means that the site is fairly
  feature complete, but with some limitations and probably bugs (many more features are
  in the pipeline, however). To improve, test and stabilize the software, new users are most
  welcome to sign up as beta testers.</p>

<p>If you are interested in getting an account, please send an email to
  <a href="mailto:beta@teoremer.com">beta@teoremer.com</a> and tell us:
  <ul>
    <li>Your name</li>
    <li>The email address you wish to use for login (if different from your sender address)</li>
    <li>Short background (only for internal use; are you a student, teacher, researcher, other?)</li>
  </ul></p>
